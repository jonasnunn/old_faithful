      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I will be creating a website for a real company called Old Faithful Fountains based in Dallas, Texas. They are a small business that specializes in commercial water features. They do both maintenance and installation work. However, they do not currently have a working website so I will be creating that to help boost their online presence and revenue. The websites primary purpose will be to convey what their services are to potential customers. I want the website to look professional and effectively tell people what the company wants them to know.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>There will be 3 main audiences for this website. Number one will be the existing customers of Old Faithful Fountains. The second is new customers or those who are interested in what they do. And finally those they have done work for previously who once again need service. All of these audiences will have in common that they need the information about company (contact info, services offered, etc) and they should see a professional well designed site.</p>  <!-- change this -->
